He became fascinated with wine and the science\nof winemaking and began to learn everything he could about the process.\nWhile interviewing for that \u201creal job\u201d, the interviewer asked him what he had been doing with his time\nsince graduation. After speaking passionately and at length about wine, the interviewer said, \u201cYou seem\nto love that so much. Why do you want this job?\u201d Rob realized he didn't want it, actually. He thanked the\nman, and thus began a career in the wine industry.\nRob has since earned his MS in Viticulture & Enology from the University of California Davis and worked\nfor many prestigious wineries including Cakebread, Stag\u2019s Leap Wine Cellars, and La Crema. Rob began\ncrafting Jessup Cellars in the 2009 season and took the position of Director of Winemaking at Jessup\nCellars in 2010. He now heads up our winemaking for the Good Life Wine Collective, which also includes\nHandwritten Wines\nBernardo Munoz Winemaker\nBIOGRAPHY\nHometown: Campeche, Mex\nFavorite Jessup Wine Pairing: 2010 Manny\u2019s Blend with Mongolian Pork Chops from Mustards Grill \u2013\nrichness paired with richness\nAbout: Bernardo began his career in the vineyards, learning the intricacies of grape growing and how to\nadjust to the whims of Mother Nature. He then moved into the cellars at Jessup Cellars, bringing us his\ncomplete grape to bottle knowledge to the team. He has a keen understanding of what it takes to make a\ngreat bottle.\nWhite Wine\nOur leading white wine is our Napa Valley Chardonnay from the Los Carneros region. The Truchard\nVineyard is perfectly located in the hills above Highway 12 with the San Francisco Bay influences creating\na cooler growing climate where the grapes ripen slowly and perfectly on the vine. The perfect weather\ncombines with an ideal terroir to create the foundation for a well-balanced Chardonnay aged for 10\nmonths in 40% new American Oak barrels. We also offer an annual harvest of Sauvignon Blanc which is\nsourced from North Coast vines outside of the Napa Valley. The tropical nature of our 2023 Sauvignon\nBlanc is decidedly different than the typical Sauvignon Blanc grown in the Valley and elsewhere in the\nWorld. Due to its limited supply this wine sells out quickly each year so be sure to give us a call before\nvisiting our tasting room to check availability.\nThe Jessup Cellars 2022 Chardonnay is a white wine that comes across as very well balanced due to the\naging being done in a combination of 40% new American and 60% neutral American Oak. This brings\nhints of oak to the wine while also offering a slightly creamy mouth feel without being a butter bomb. Our\nNapa Valley Chardonnay is a member favorite while the non-member price of $55 is appreciated by\nenthusiasts of this quality wine crafted by Rob Lloyd. The alcohol content is 14.8% while the PH is 3.4.\nOur sold out 2023 100% Sauvignon Blanc vintage is sourced from North Coast vineyards aged in 100%\nstainless steel barrels which is typical for this varietal. The stainless steel seals out the oxygen and seals\nin the flavors of the fruit and is a hearty 15.1% alcohol content with a PH of 3.3. While it's nose and\nflavors hint at tropical delights, we would not consider this wine to be too fruit forward, but rather fruit\nbalanced with hints of pineapple and mango. Our Sauvignon Blanc is the perfect hot tub wine or for those\nwarm summer evenings after a long day in the hot summer Sun. You will feel refreshed after enjoying a\nglass or two of our Sauvignon Blanc, non-member price of $45!\nThe 2023 Sauvignon Blanc pairs wonderfully with a variety of dishes, enhancing the dining experience.\nFor starters, it complements the flavors of Grilled Prawn Cocktail and Ceviche, accentuating the seafood's\ndelicate taste and brightening the citrus elements in the dishes. The wine's fruity and floral notes\nbeautifully complement the freshness of Tacos, making it an ideal match for this flavorful and versatile\nMexican dish. Lastly, the wine's high acidity and fruit-forward character provide a delightful contrast to the\ncreamy sweetness of a Peach & Burrata salad, creating a harmonious and memorable pairing.\nRed Wine\nJessup Cellars offers a number of red wines across a range of varietals, from Pinot Noir and Merlot\nblends from the Truchard Vineyard, to blended Cabernet Sauvignon from both the Napa and Alexander\nValleys, our Mendocino Rougette combining Grenache and Carignan varietals which we refer to as our\n'Summer Red', to the ultimate expression of the 'Art of the Blend\" with our Juel and Table for Four Red\nWines. We also offer 100% Zinfandel from 134 year old vines in the Mendocino region and our own 100%\nPetite Sirah grown in the Wooden Valley in Southeastern Napa County. We also offer some seasonal\nfavorites, led by the popular whimsical Manny's Blend which should be released later in 2024 with a very\nspecial label.\nWhat makes our Pinot Noir unique from typical Pinot is the added element of the Jessup 'Art of the Blend'.\nWhile it is 96.7% Pinot Noir with fruit sourced from our favorite Los Carneros Truchard Vineyard, our\nmaster winemakers blend in a little (3.3%) of our own Petite Sirah from our estate vineyard in the Wooden\nValley area of Southeastern Napa County and age it in 50% new French oak for 10 months The alcohol\ncontent of this vintage is 14.8% with a PH of 3.45.This gives our 2021 Pinot Noir a much bolder color,\nvery different from your typical light and bright Pinot you may be accustomed to. This also adds body to\nthe wine which has become a member favorite at Jessup Cellars, priced at $70 for non-members.\nJessup Cellars 2019 Rougette is the perfect blend of Spanish varietals including 87% Grenache and 13%\nCarignane, both coming from our Mendocino growing region which is particularly suited for what we refer\nto as our 'Summer Red'. This beautiful wine of co-fermented Grenache and Carignan varieties greets you\nwith opulent aromas of sweet strawberry, ripe cranberry jam, red plum, cassis, and nutmeg. We aghe this\nwine by co-fermenting the varietals for 15 months in used (neutral) Chardonnay barrels and delivers a\n14.9% alcohol content with a PH of 3.35. The non-member price is $60. The palate is wonderfully dry and\nlifted with fresh acidity and silky, rich tannins. Flavors of brambly, ripe fruit make this wine exceptionally\npalatable and food-friendly. Enjoy it with duck confit, mushroom risotto or an assortment of softer\ncheeses. Drink now or cellar 2-3 years.\nJessup Cellars has a history of making fine big Zinfandels, but the 2020 Pacini Vineyards 100% Zinfandel\nfrom the Talmage Bench in Mendocino County is decidedly different than your typical Zin, with the grapes\nfor this wine coming from 134 year old \"ancient vines\". Brimming with nuances of ripe cranberry,\npomegranate, cherry cola, white pepper, and vanilla, this wine offers soft tannins with a nice, long finish.\nThis wine is aged in used (neutral) Chardonnay barrels with an alcohol content of 14.9%. The price is $60\nfor non-members Pair with pastas, barbequed meats or just pour yourself a glass and enjoy on its own.\nDrink now after decanting or age for up to 9 years.\nOur 2019 Jessup Cellars Merlot is from the Truchard Vineyard in the Los Carneros region of the Napa\nValley which enjoys the San Francisco Bay influences that also envelope our Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.\nThe terroir is ideally suited for a full bodied Merlot and like many of our wines, our Merlot is reflective of\nthe 'Art of the Blend' by our winemakers. The 2019 Merlot is 80% Merlot, 16.5% Cabernet Sauvignon\nfrom the Chiles Valley AVA in Northeastern Napa County and a splash of our Petite Sirah (3.5%) from the\nsame location finishes the wine perfectly. Our merlot is aged for 22 months in 40% new American/French\noak with an alcohol content of 15.1% with a PH level of 3.55. This wine drinks well now, however, will\ncontinue to age gracefully for another 5-8 years. We recommend trying this delicious Merlot with roasted\nchicken and vegetables or beef bourguignon. Non-members can pick up our 2019 Napa Valley Merlot for\n$70.\nJessup\u2019s Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is a staple of most Napa Valley winemakers with Jessup\noffering our 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon for 2024. As with most of our red wines, our winemakers exercise\n'The Art of the Blend' by starting with 90% Napa Valley fruit from the Chiles Valley AVA in Northeastern\nNapa County, then blend in 5% Petite Sirah from the same AVA, 3% Merlot from our Truchard Vineyard in\nthe Los Carneros region, then finish it with 2.1% Cabernet Franc, which is the parent grape of both\nCabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, often used in blended wines. Cabernet Franc originated in the Bordeaux\nregion of France and to honor that provenance, we age our 2019 Jessup Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon in\n80% new French oak for 22 months. Alcohol content in this varietal is 14.9% with a PH of 3.65. You can\npurchase our 2019 Cab for $90. The palate of the wine matches the aromatics providing juicy fruit flavors,\nrich tannins and a long finish. This wine drinks well now however will age gracefully for the next 5-8\nyears. Enjoy this Cabernet Sauvignon with a quality cut of beef or any dish that has a nice smoky/fatty/or\ncharred quality.\nJessup Cellars has also created a 2018 Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon with 96.5% Cabernet\ngrapes, finished with 3.5% Napa Valley Petite Sirah fruit. This wine has a very different nose and mouth\nfeel than our 2019 Cabernet, presenting a dry, more tannic finish which still feels young but full bodied as\nit crosses your palate. You could lay this bottle down for another 5-8 years as you wait for it to soften, but\nif you want to drink it now, we encourage you to pair this wine with a nice Filet Mignon or other red meat.\nOur Alexander Valley Cabernet is aged in 80% new French oak with an alcohol content of 14.9% and may\nbe purchased for $90 for non-members.\n2019 GRAZIELLA SANGIOVESE BLEND is sold out\n$95.00\n\"Graziella\" is one of the most unique wines that we produce. This harmonious blend of Sangiovese and\nCabernet Sauvignon is one of our smallest production wines which makes it a very special treat for\nwhoever is able to get their hands on it! Our 2019 \"Graziella\" showcases a perfect balance on the nose\nand palate, expressing aromas and flavors of strawberry, red plum, raspberry, vanilla, and rose petal.\nThe mouthfeel is bright and has just the right amount of acidity which makes this wine a wonderful\ncompliment to a variety of dishes. Pair \"Graziella\" with red sauce dishes like lasagna or spiced meat\ndishes like lamb with rosemary. Drink now or cellar this wine for another 5-8 years to see how beautifully\nit develops.\nWINEMAKER NOTES\nComposition: 75% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon\nAppellation: Napa Valley\nAging: 15 months in French oak\nAlcohol: 14.9%\nPH: 3.6\nJessup Cellars 2019 Juel Red Wine is one exploration of the ultimate 'Art of the Blend' expression. Juel is\nnamed in homage to the Father of one of our owner families which is of Swiss origin. Our winemakers\nhave built a Jessup favorite with this wine composed of 56% Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon and 14%\nCabernet Franc, with Merlot figuring heavily into the blend at 24% from our Truchard Vineyard fruit. The\nwine is finished with 2% each of Petite Sirah, Petite Verdot and Malbec, all from the Napa Valley. Jessup\nCellars' 2019 \"Juel\" Blend is a harmonious composition of varietals, a testament to the artistry of\nwinemaking. This wine is a celebration of balance, with its blend of dark fruit, baking spices, and earthy\nelements coming together in perfect unison. Approachable yet age-worthy, \"Juel\" is a sensory journey\nthat invites you to savor the intricacies of each sip. Pour a glass, and let the symphony unfold. The\nnon-member price for Juel is $115. Juel is aged in 70% new French oak for 22 months with 14.9% alcohol\nby volume. The PH is 3.65.\n2019 TABLE FOR FOUR CABERNET BLEND\n$115.00\n\"Table for Four\" is our celebrated and signature Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend and is anxiously\nanticipated by both guests and staff alike each year upon its release. Our 2019 vintage carries on the\ntradition of comprising a wine of distinction and depth, with layers of complexity to titillate any wine\nenthusiast. With notes of ripe black cherry and blackberry on the nose, the luscious fruit is accompanied\nby warm and inviting aromas of baking spice and dark cacao. An intriguing layer of subtle floral and\nherbal undertones enhances the complexity, with violet, anise, and a hint of spearmint adding nuance to\nthis incredible profile. The palate sings with harmony as the fruit and spice components interplay, and\nfine, compact tannins give this wine the structural integrity to age for many years to come. With a lovely\nlingering finish, enjoy this wine now for a vibrant experience on the palate, or cellar it to increase its\nnuance in years to come.\nWINEMAKER NOTES\nComposition: 61.8% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26.5% Cabernet Franc, 4.2% Petite Verdot, 3.5% Petite Sirah,\n2.7% Malbec, 1.1% Merlot\nAppellation: 100% Napa Valley\nAging: 22 months in 70% new french oak\nABV: 14.9%\nPH 3.65\nJessup Cellars has introduced our first estate grown 100% Petite Sirah beginning with the 2021 vintage\nas a standalone wine, while also using it extensively in our 'Art of the Blend' winemaking process going\nforward. Our 2021 Petite Sirah offers a captivating sensory journey with a complex blend of flavors and\naromas. The wine opens with luscious notes of blueberry and tart cherry, creating a vibrant and fruity\nintroduction. Pomegranate adds a touch of brightness, complemented by the subtle sweetness of brown\nsugar and the deep richness of cassis. The influence of bourbon and sour mash emerges, contributing a\nlayer of complexity with hints of oak and a delightful cake batter essence. Notes of plum jam adds a\ncomforting touch of sweetness, while cracked pepper brings a subtle spice that enhances the overall\nprofile.The wine showcases robust yet approachable tannins, providing a structured backbone that\npromises aging potential. Bright acidity adds a refreshing quality, balancing the richness of the fruit and\ncontributing to the wine's overall harmony. The finish is long and satisfying, leaving lingering impressions\nof cedar, licorice, and the delicate essence of raspberry. To say the least, there is a lot going on with this\nsublime wine. This wine is aged for 22 months in a mix of used (neutral) French and American barrels\nand is our \"hottest\" wine with an alcohol content of 15.6% with a PH of 3.65.\nOur estate vineyard in the Wooden Valley of Southeastern Napa County will be the foundation for our\ncontinued growth in the Napa Valley.\nFortified and Port Style Wines\nJessup Cellars makes a few fortified vintages of their Zinfandel Port and offers a 100% Cabernet\nSauvignon dessert wine. Jessup Cellars is currently offering our 2013 100% Zinfandel Port fortified with\nBrandy. Some of the most unique and long-lived wines in the World are Port wines. Paying homage to\ntradition, Jessup Cellars has always been known for making quality small batches of Port style wines from\nZinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes. The 2013 Zinfandel Port is just another phenomenal addition\nto that family. Boasting bold aromatics of ripe raspberry, leather, and spice on the nose, followed by\nvanilla and red plum that dances on the palate.

The Infinite Reflection\n13th Recursion is 100% Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon aged for 12 years in French oak with an\nalcohol content of 19.5%. Non-members may purchase this wine for $85.\nThe Solera method is a traditional aging and blending process commonly used in the production of\nfortified wines, including dessert wines like Sherry and Madeira. Here's how it works:\nTiered Stacking: The process begins with a series of barrels or casks arranged in a tiered system called a\n\"solera stack.\" The bottom row contains the oldest wine, while subsequent rows contain progressively\nyounger wines. Fractional Blending: Each year, a portion of wine is drawn from the bottom row of barrels\nfor bottling. This creates space in those barrels, which are then topped up with wine from the row above.\nThe process continues up the stack, with each barrel being partially emptied and then replenished with\nyounger wine. Aging and Maturity: Because the barrels are only partially emptied each year, a portion of\nthe older wine always remains in the barrels, contributing to the complexity and depth of flavor. Over time,\nthe younger wines gradually blend with and inherit characteristics from the older wines.\nConsistency: The Solera method ensures consistency in the final product, as the blend of wines remains\nrelatively constant over time. Even though some wine is removed for bottling each year, the overall\ncharacter of the solera remains consistent due to the blending of older and younger wines.\nPerpetual Process: The Solera system is designed to be perpetual, with new wine continuously added at\nthe top and matured wine drawn from the bottom for bottling. This allows producers to maintain a\nconsistent product while also ensuring that some of the original wine remains in the solera stack,\nsometimes for many years or even decades. Overall, the Solera method is a meticulous and\ntime-honored process that results in complex, well-balanced dessert wines with layers of flavor and\naroma.\nTasting Experiences\nJessup Cellars offers many experiences for enjoying our wines.

The perfect weather combines with an ideal terroir to create the foundation for a well-balanced Chardonnay aged for 10 months in 40% new American Oak barrels. We also offer an annual harvest of Sauvignon Blanc which is sourced from North Coast vines outside of the Napa Valley. The tropical nature of our 2023 Sauvignon Blanc is decidedly different than the typical Sauvignon Blanc grown in the Valley and elsewhere in the World. Due to its limited supply this wine sells out quickly each year so be sure to give us a call before visiting our tasting room to check availability."

The stainless steel seals out the oxygen and seals in the flavors of the fruit and is a hearty 15.1% alcohol content with a PH of 3.3. While it's nose and flavors hint at tropical delights, we would not consider this wine to be too fruit forward, but rather fruit balanced with hints of pineapple and mango. Our Sauvignon Blanc is the perfect hot tub wine or for those warm summer evenings after a long day in the hot summer Sun. You will feel refreshed after enoying a glass or two of our Sauvignon Blanc, non-member price of $45!\n\nThe 2023 Sauvignon Blanc pairs wonderfully with a variety of dishes, enhancing the dining experience. For starters, it complements the flavors of Grilled Prawn Cocktail and Ceviche, accentuating the seafood's delicate taste and brightening the citrus elements in the dishes. The wine's fruity and floral notes beautifully complement the freshness of Tacos, making it an ideal match for this flavorful and versatile Mexican dish.

Here's how it works:\nTiered Stacking: The process begins with a series of barrels or casks arranged in a tiered system called a \"solera stack.\" The bottom row contains the oldest wine, while subsequent rows contain progressively younger wines.\nFractional Blending: Each year, a portion of wine is drawn from the bottom row of barrels for bottling. This creates space in those barrels, which are then topped up with wine from the row above. The process continues up the stack, with each barrel being partially emptied and then replenished with younger wine.\nAging and Maturity: Because the barrels are only partially emptied each year, a portion of the older wine always remains in the barrels, contributing to the complexity and depth of flavor. Over time, the younger wines gradually blend with and inherit characteristics from the older wines.\nConsistency: The Solera method ensures consistency in the final product, as the blend of wines remains relatively constant over time. Even though some wine is removed for bottling each year, the overall character of the solera remains consistent due to the blending of older and younger wines.\nPerpetual Process: The Solera system is designed to be perpetual, with new wine continuously added at the top and matured wine drawn from the bottom for bottling. This allows producers to maintain a consistent product while also ensuring that some of the original wine remains in the solera stack, sometimes for many years or even decades.\nOverall, the Solera method is a meticulous and time-honored process that results in complex, well-balanced dessert wines with layers of flavor and aroma."
